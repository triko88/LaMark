# This is the heading of the test file called test.md
Some text in the paragraph to show you the abilities of this parser. **Some bold text here,** *some italic text here* and ~~some text I want to cross out~~.

Another paragraph for the fun, meanwhile you can go to [my website](https://pixeltrik.vercel.app/) about [what I learned from UNIX](https://pixeltrik.vercel.app/blogs/on-most-people-teaching-unix).

## Sub heading for no reason
### Subsub heading again for no context
Just adding text for the sake of adding. And also for showing the ***bold italic combination*** too.
